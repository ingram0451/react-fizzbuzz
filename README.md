# react-fizzbuzz

## About
This React project is implemented as a Frontend app communicates with an API service which returns the very simple "FizzBuzz" results.

The API service is developed on Symfony3.4 framework, [code is here](https://github.com/ingram0451/symfony3_api)


## How to use
The project requires `npm` installed and follows the standard React Demo app as:

```
npm install
```

```
npm run
```

Then, the service is default to run at:  
`http://localhost:3000/`

The app is expecting data from (which is the default config on the Symfony3 side):  
`http://localhost:8000/fizzbuzz/api`
